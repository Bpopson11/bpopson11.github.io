          Hello! My name is Brianna Popson, though most everyone calls me Bri. I am just beginning my education in the world of web development and coding at Epicodus in Portland, OR. Before this I obtained my Masters of Finance and was working in accounting. And before that I was a substitue pre-school teacher! I have had a range of jobs in my life since graduating college. Despite my undergrad degree also being in accounting and finance, I realized those fields weren't for me.

          A lot of my friends earned their degrees in Computer Science in college and enjoy their careers are programmers. The intricacies of programming and coding was what caught my eye. I love to figure out puzzles and see how things work, so Epicodus came as a perfect opportunity. I've learned a lot so far and have a ways to go, but below you can find a few of my projects I've created with fellow Epicodus students.
